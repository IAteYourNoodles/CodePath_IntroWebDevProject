    <h2 id="about">About My Topic</h2>
    <p style="width: 1024px">Food waste is a significant issue contributing to greenhouse gas emissions through rotting food. It occurs throughout the food supply chain but can be further mitigated by focusing on consumers at home. People at home can be more efficient in their meal planning and often overbuy amounts of food that will not be used before their expiration dates.

      <h3>Landfills</h3>
      <p style="width: 1536px; margin-left: 5%;">Consumer-sided food waste encompasses the leftovers pushed to the back of the fridge, the untouched fruits and vegetables spoiling in the pantry, and the meals abandoned on restaurant plates. This type of waste not only squanders precious resources like water, land, and energy used in food production but also contributes to environmental degradation through methane emissions in landfills. Food waste accumulates in landfills, which are a major source of greenhouse gas emissions. Rotting food produces methane which is a greenhouse gas that can be considered worse than carbon dioxide.

      <h3>Consumer-Sided Food Waste</h3>
      <p style="width: 1536px; margin-left: 5%">The largest source of food waste comes from consumers. The majority of food waste is produced in the home, which can be mitigated by the decisions of conscious consumer. Addressing consumer-sided food waste requires a multifaceted approach involving education on meal planning and portion control, innovative packaging solutions to extend food shelf life, and policies that encourage donation and composting. By minimizing consumer-sided food waste, individuals can play a crucial role in building a more sustainable and efficient food system.
